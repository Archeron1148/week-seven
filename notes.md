ABM:

    A model is a representation of a phenomenon as a set of elements and their relationships; the key term being representation. It is a generalization/abstraction/simplification of what we consider as THE phenomenon.
    models are NOT equivalent reproductions of a phenomenon, but tools for observing and interacting with it. What we could define as imaginative models, such as the smiling pineapple, though still able to exist for other purposes, can be clearly distinguished from models with some degree of truth, because they fail to match our sensible experience and are incompatible with other successful models. Those that cannot be distinguished, should be considered valid, competing models; their study, validation, and improvement being the main goal of scientific endeavours.
    Models are not only inevitable for any living mind, but they are also the keystone for the generation of knowledge. 
    Depending on their background, readers can potentially miss altogether that we are referring to a model, and consider the elements of our model as loose speculations or, worse, as given facts.
    The terms on which we define a model are its assumptions. 
    This being the case, I am always amused when these same people challenge me with the question, “Can you validate your model?” The appropriate retort, of course, is, “Can you validate yours?” At least I can write mine down so that it can, in principle, be calibrated to data, if that is what you mean by “validate,” a term I assiduously avoid (good Popperian that I am). The choice, then, is not whether to build models; it’s whether to build explicit ones. 
    In practice, ‘autonomy’ often translates as the agents’ ability to take action, to move, to decide, or even think and remember. 
    In simple terms, building a model involves the following steps.
        - Define hypotheses, questions or simply the phenomenon of interest (identify the system)
        - Define the elements and processes (you believe are) required to address the system (model the system). mention paradox Occam’s razor vs. emergence
        - Express the chosen elements and processes as computer code (implement the model)
        Modeling is a process of constant iteration. Each stage is an iteration loop that is often repeated several times before jumping into the next step. The end result of development and exploration of a model may be relatively stable, often in the form of publications. However, this product potentially feeds a new modeling effort (and that is actually the main usefulness of models in the long run).

Messy Assemblages, Residuality and Recursion within a Phygital Nexus
https://epoiesen.library.carleton.ca/2019/03/16/messy-assemblages/

    This visual essay is a reflection on the movement of objects and images within the phygital and, in particular, how different components of assemblages meet, mingle and sometimes experience ontological shifts, when an artist and an archaeologist, and their practices and apparatus, intra-act within a ‘phygital nexus’.
    Phygital objects are digitally defined but can be invoked, instantiated and brought into constellation with other entities both physically and virtually.
    The term ‘assemblage’ has many connotations. In art it refers to the combination of found and collected objects into a composition (e.g. Figure 2). 
    As Theodor Adorno would say “Art is magic delivered from the lie of being truth”. 
    In archaeology, the concept of assemblage has traditionally had two main distinct, but overlapping, meanings. It can refer to “a collection of objects associated on the basis of their depositional or spatial find-context (e.g. midden assemblage) and a collection of one type of object found within a site or area (e.g. pottery assemblage)” (Lucas 2012, 193-4). 
    However, Gavin Lucas, building on Manuel DeLanda’s assemblage theory, who draws, residually, on the philosophy of Giles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, has rearticulated the concept of archaeological assemblages to foreground their external relationships, such as their relations to their environment and other assemblages, as opposed to the internal conﬁgurations of their component parts, which are recognized as having a certain amount of autonomy, insofar as they can move between assemblages and recombine elsewhere in other spatiotemporal contexts.
    Colonization is shaped by the dual processes of enchainment (also described as coding, or citation) and exposure (or deterritorialization). This force maintains the material coherence of the assemblage even though it might be displaced, perhaps far away, in time and space from its original setting and meaning. 
    By contrast, the entropic force of dissipation harnesses the twin processes of containment and dispersal, meaning that elements of an assemblage break up and disintegrate, but largely remain close to their original setting. 
    ‘Residuality’ refers to the phenomenon of objects, fragments or materials that persist and reoccur in contexts other than those they originated in (e.g., Brown 1995; Lucas 2017).
    Consider the sinking of a well. The excavator cuts through pre-existing deposits redepositing materials from earlier temporal horizons into subsequent, increasingly messy, assemblages and contexts containing (re)mixed, or reworked, components originating from multiple temporal horizons. In this shift of context some residual objects within the assemblage may experience ontological transformations.
    ***all DSLR images and digital scans are based on point measurements and no matter what resolution is adopted they are still only digital surface samples, and consequently always considerably less than the original subject under examination (Carter 2017). When such point readings are interpolated into meshes for 3D renders or 3D printing a significant proportion of these sampled data are discarded algorithmically. In other words more detail is being lost with each new recursive rendering, print or scan.***

    Unfortunately, the only surviving residue of the first minster movie is a JPEG3 recursion of a VHS PAL tape video, which itself was copied from a U-matic video tape master. It serves to remind us that while the initial geometric definition of the re-imagined Old Minster may have been orthothetic in nature (Stiegler n.d.), each instantiation, re-registration (e.g. scan, JPEG photographs, video, or 3D print) and, more often than we might realise, every time such digital instantiations are compressed for transmission a degree of digital decay or entropy is introduced (e.g., Figures 17, 21 & 22). 
    Like the assemblages we feature, our commentary is messy

Messy Assemblages, Residuality and Recursion within a Phygital Nexus: First Response
https://epoiesen.library.carleton.ca/2019/07/26/messy-assemblages-response1/

    A messy assemblage of the virtual and physical is at the core of this tenet [(transubstantiation)] of the Catholic tradition. If the authors have 'merely' recast transubstantiation into a modern context and are using the idea as a way to think through the relationships between physical and digital things, so what? What does a sincere belief in a modern transubstatiation do for us as archaeologicsts, artists and thinkers about the material world?
    ***Our modern, Western, scientifically oriented slice of society is perhaps rather unusual in that it lacks a sincere belief in a transubstatiation-like phenomenon. It is, perhaps, this lack of faith in things outside the bounds of logic that drives a fascination with the phygital and transformations within it. The phygital is alluring precisely because it provides an opportunity, within the framework of scientific modernity, to connect with the mystical or spiritual, or at least with the more-than-physical. In creating a phygital nexus, as the authors do with Winchester Minster, they effectively become priests or true believers, with the heady power to invoke a transubstiation.***
    That the meaning of an object changes dependant on its context is a truism, but inflected into the realm of the phygital, which implies repeated transformation as part of the character of the realm, it becomes an inheretn and cental property of being a phygital thing.
