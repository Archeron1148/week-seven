ABM:

    A model is a representation of a phenomenon as a set of elements and their relationships; the key term being representation. It is a generalization/abstraction/simplification of what we consider as THE phenomenon.
    models are NOT equivalent reproductions of a phenomenon, but tools for observing and interacting with it. What we could define as imaginative models, such as the smiling pineapple, though still able to exist for other purposes, can be clearly distinguished from models with some degree of truth, because they fail to match our sensible experience and are incompatible with other successful models. Those that cannot be distinguished, should be considered valid, competing models; their study, validation, and improvement being the main goal of scientific endeavours.
    Models are not only inevitable for any living mind, but they are also the keystone for the generation of knowledge. 
    Depending on their background, readers can potentially miss altogether that we are referring to a model, and consider the elements of our model as loose speculations or, worse, as given facts.
    The terms on which we define a model are its assumptions. 
    This being the case, I am always amused when these same people challenge me with the question, “Can you validate your model?” The appropriate retort, of course, is, “Can you validate yours?” At least I can write mine down so that it can, in principle, be calibrated to data, if that is what you mean by “validate,” a term I assiduously avoid (good Popperian that I am). The choice, then, is not whether to build models; it’s whether to build explicit ones. 
    In practice, ‘autonomy’ often translates as the agents’ ability to take action, to move, to decide, or even think and remember. 
    In simple terms, building a model involves the following steps.
        - Define hypotheses, questions or simply the phenomenon of interest (identify the system)
        - Define the elements and processes (you believe are) required to address the system (model the system). mention paradox Occam’s razor vs. emergence
        - Express the chosen elements and processes as computer code (implement the model)
        Modeling is a process of constant iteration. Each stage is an iteration loop that is often repeated several times before jumping into the next step. The end result of development and exploration of a model may be relatively stable, often in the form of publications. However, this product potentially feeds a new modeling effort (and that is actually the main usefulness of models in the long run).
