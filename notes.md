ABM:

    A model is a representation of a phenomenon as a set of elements and their relationships; the key term being representation. It is a generalization/abstraction/simplification of what we consider as THE phenomenon.
    models are NOT equivalent reproductions of a phenomenon, but tools for observing and interacting with it. What we could define as imaginative models, such as the smiling pineapple, though still able to exist for other purposes, can be clearly distinguished from models with some degree of truth, because they fail to match our sensible experience and are incompatible with other successful models. Those that cannot be distinguished, should be considered valid, competing models; their study, validation, and improvement being the main goal of scientific endeavours.
    Models are not only inevitable for any living mind, but they are also the keystone for the generation of knowledge. 
    Depending on their background, readers can potentially miss altogether that we are referring to a model, and consider the elements of our model as loose speculations or, worse, as given facts.
    The terms on which we define a model are its assumptions. 
    This being the case, I am always amused when these same people challenge me with the question, “Can you validate your model?” The appropriate retort, of course, is, “Can you validate yours?” At least I can write mine down so that it can, in principle, be calibrated to data, if that is what you mean by “validate,” a term I assiduously avoid (good Popperian that I am). The choice, then, is not whether to build models; it’s whether to build explicit ones. 
    In practice, ‘autonomy’ often translates as the agents’ ability to take action, to move, to decide, or even think and remember. 
    In simple terms, building a model involves the following steps.
        - Define hypotheses, questions or simply the phenomenon of interest (identify the system)
        - Define the elements and processes (you believe are) required to address the system (model the system). mention paradox Occam’s razor vs. emergence
        - Express the chosen elements and processes as computer code (implement the model)
        Modeling is a process of constant iteration. Each stage is an iteration loop that is often repeated several times before jumping into the next step. The end result of development and exploration of a model may be relatively stable, often in the form of publications. However, this product potentially feeds a new modeling effort (and that is actually the main usefulness of models in the long run).

Messy Assemblages, Residuality and Recursion within a Phygital Nexus
https://epoiesen.library.carleton.ca/2019/03/16/messy-assemblages/

    This visual essay is a reflection on the movement of objects and images within the phygital and, in particular, how different components of assemblages meet, mingle and sometimes experience ontological shifts, when an artist and an archaeologist, and their practices and apparatus, intra-act within a ‘phygital nexus’.
    Phygital objects are digitally defined but can be invoked, instantiated and brought into constellation with other entities both physically and virtually.
    The term ‘assemblage’ has many connotations. In art it refers to the combination of found and collected objects into a composition (e.g. Figure 2). 
    As Theodor Adorno would say “Art is magic delivered from the lie of being truth”. 
    In archaeology, the concept of assemblage has traditionally had two main distinct, but overlapping, meanings. It can refer to “a collection of objects associated on the basis of their depositional or spatial find-context (e.g. midden assemblage) and a collection of one type of object found within a site or area (e.g. pottery assemblage)” (Lucas 2012, 193-4). 
    However, Gavin Lucas, building on Manuel DeLanda’s assemblage theory, who draws, residually, on the philosophy of Giles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, has rearticulated the concept of archaeological assemblages to foreground their external relationships, such as their relations to their environment and other assemblages, as opposed to the internal conﬁgurations of their component parts, which are recognized as having a certain amount of autonomy, insofar as they can move between assemblages and recombine elsewhere in other spatiotemporal contexts.
    Colonization is shaped by the dual processes of enchainment (also described as coding, or citation) and exposure (or deterritorialization). This force maintains the material coherence of the assemblage even though it might be displaced, perhaps far away, in time and space from its original setting and meaning. 
    By contrast, the entropic force of dissipation harnesses the twin processes of containment and dispersal, meaning that elements of an assemblage break up and disintegrate, but largely remain close to their original setting. 
    ‘Residuality’ refers to the phenomenon of objects, fragments or materials that persist and reoccur in contexts other than those they originated in (e.g., Brown 1995; Lucas 2017).
    Consider the sinking of a well. The excavator cuts through pre-existing deposits redepositing materials from earlier temporal horizons into subsequent, increasingly messy, assemblages and contexts containing (re)mixed, or reworked, components originating from multiple temporal horizons. In this shift of context some residual objects within the assemblage may experience ontological transformations.
    ***all DSLR images and digital scans are based on point measurements and no matter what resolution is adopted they are still only digital surface samples, and consequently always considerably less than the original subject under examination (Carter 2017). When such point readings are interpolated into meshes for 3D renders or 3D printing a significant proportion of these sampled data are discarded algorithmically. In other words more detail is being lost with each new recursive rendering, print or scan.***

    Unfortunately, the only surviving residue of the first minster movie is a JPEG3 recursion of a VHS PAL tape video, which itself was copied from a U-matic video tape master. It serves to remind us that while the initial geometric definition of the re-imagined Old Minster may have been orthothetic in nature (Stiegler n.d.), each instantiation, re-registration (e.g. scan, JPEG photographs, video, or 3D print) and, more often than we might realise, every time such digital instantiations are compressed for transmission a degree of digital decay or entropy is introduced (e.g., Figures 17, 21 & 22). 
    Like the assemblages we feature, our commentary is messy

Messy Assemblages, Residuality and Recursion within a Phygital Nexus: First Response
https://epoiesen.library.carleton.ca/2019/07/26/messy-assemblages-response1/

    A messy assemblage of the virtual and physical is at the core of this tenet [(transubstantiation)] of the Catholic tradition. If the authors have 'merely' recast transubstantiation into a modern context and are using the idea as a way to think through the relationships between physical and digital things, so what? What does a sincere belief in a modern transubstatiation do for us as archaeologicsts, artists and thinkers about the material world?
    ***Our modern, Western, scientifically oriented slice of society is perhaps rather unusual in that it lacks a sincere belief in a transubstatiation-like phenomenon. It is, perhaps, this lack of faith in things outside the bounds of logic that drives a fascination with the phygital and transformations within it. The phygital is alluring precisely because it provides an opportunity, within the framework of scientific modernity, to connect with the mystical or spiritual, or at least with the more-than-physical. In creating a phygital nexus, as the authors do with Winchester Minster, they effectively become priests or true believers, with the heady power to invoke a transubstiation.***
    That the meaning of an object changes dependant on its context is a truism, but inflected into the realm of the phygital, which implies repeated transformation as part of the character of the realm, it becomes an inheretn and cental property of being a phygital thing.

Avatars, Monsters, and Machines: A Cyborg Archaeology
https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-journal-of-archaeology/article/avatars-monsters-and-machines-a-cyborg-archaeology/CD467A5E5232B50D6CAA4D72091FCFA9/core-reader

    Writing about the representation of prehistoric humans, Diane Gifford-Gonzalez (1993: 26) states that artists are mining arcane knowledge to make simulacra or ‘science fictions’ of archaeological evidence.
    Yet Gifford-Gonzalez is riffing on Donna Haraway (1989: 3), who notes that ‘both science and popular culture are intricately woven of fact and fiction’—which share the same Latin root, facere, to make. Facts, Haraway states, are descendants of the past participle (factum), done, unchanging, ‘fit only to be recorded’—as in artefacts—whereas ‘fiction is an active form, referring to a present act of fashioning’ (Haraway, 1989: 4) as in the act of interpretation, of storytelling. 
    Following Gifford-Gonzalez and Haraway, I am not stating that archaeological interpretation is not true, but that it has the immense potential to be true, to resonate with all the passion and fire of science fiction novels, movies, or comic books. I posit that science fictions allow the past and present to become permeable through the creation of a shared interstitial space.

    Whereas many seek to seamlessly embed digital technologies into everyday archaeological methodologies, archaeologists should cultivate an alternative, posthuman feminist practice that dives into the uncanny valley, highlights chronological disruptions, that queers and interferes with our understanding of ourselves and the past.
    A cyborg archaeology is a practice in worlding, in Heidegger's (2010) sense of being-in-the-world, but also as world-building in science fiction and video game creation. From this stance, creating archaeological interpretations is endlessly immersive, a process that I have compared to telepresence, ‘where you are when you are talking on the phone’ (Rucker et al., 1992).
    Users of avatars in virtual worlds are more fully immersed when their bodies ‘feel right’ and allow them to ‘construct, express, and perform the identity they are seeking’ (Taylor, 2002: 52). Some users feel as though their avatars are ‘truer’ reflections of themselves, as ‘“more them” than their corporeal body’ (Taylor, 2002: 54). 
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GX0i-onw4-Y
    Avatars inhabited an interstitial space (Figure 1), a meeting ground between the corporeal body of the user and the remains of Neolithic people of the past. Use of these avatars highlighted the tendency within archaeology to phenomenologically interpret the past as a modern, able-bodied, same-gendered, normative reflection of ourselves. Avatars can radically interfere with our assumptions about the use and navigation of space in the past. 
    Technology and research regarding avatars have moved rapidly, including greater optical fidelity, affinity with avatars with mirrored gestures, quick-creation of life-like avatar faces, but also revealing greater attachment and empathy through the use of avatars. For example, recent research has shown that changing the virtual race of a user's avatar can increase empathy and reduces implicit racial bias against people of colour (Hasler et al., 2017). 
    I have used the term monster to describe synaesthetic interventions into digital archaeology, but the term also evokes a sense of difference, of other. Monsters ‘represent the in between, the mixed, the ambivalent…[the] horrible and wonderful, object of aberration and adoration’ (Braidotti, 1997: 62). Digital interventions are Frankenstein's monsters, lurching somewhere between Tringham's ‘faceless blobs’ (1991b) and an idealized ontological collective—networked and multi-faceted but still oddly homogenous. Archaeological monsters are a human and unhuman aggregate, one that digital archaeologists should recognize as we practise assembling ‘articulations among cosmos, animal, human, machine, and landscape in their recursive sidereal, bony, electronic, and geological skeletons’ (Haraway, 1992: 329). A cyborg archaeology does not create stand-alone interventions but contributes to a collective reimagining of past and present, and of ourselves.
    In these discussions of the materiality of the technosphere, there is a missing data layer that, ironically, can be characterized by a project: TechnoSphere. TechnoSphere was a virtual world inhabited by user-generated artificial life forms, created by Jane Prophet and Gordon Selley in 1995 (Prophet, 1996, 2001). These artificial life forms ate, grew and developed, died, and passed on their genes. The project is no longer online, it ran from 1995 to 2002, then again from 2007 to 2012; arguably it has become part of the digital archaeosphere, with the only surviving remains in journal articles and low-resolution screenshots. The livestock of the data layer, their algorithmic genes, must be recovered from dead drives and data formats. Attending to the machines entails a holistic examination of the entire entity: the hardware, the software, and the human creator and operator.
    Machines are our co-authors, our playground, the under-examined skeleton, and the chattering emulators. Excavating a hard drive made us rethink archaeological methodology, and how space might be understood and constructed in the future.
